# JSON Explorer Challenge

This is the solution to the JSON Explorer Challenge by Jesus Esparza. It includes the following points:

- The JSON data is correctly displayed
- All keys can be interacted with and are highlighted
- When a user clicks on a key, it shows its path and value
- When a user types the correct path on the input, the value is displayed
- Uses Typescript
- Includes unit tests
- Usage of styled-components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
